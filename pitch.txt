In practice, this usually seems to involve getting a dump of the journals as a spreadsheet from the accountant, and doing a combination of spreadsheet wrangling and manual inspection look for:
i) journals posted outside normal working hours, when supervision or other controls may be laxer.
ii) journals that could be repeated, ie of the same amounts within a short space of time to the same or similar accounts

This is time consuming.

Even with a decent level of spreadsheet knowledge, it can be a pain in the ass to extract all the information from a massive spreadsheet the accountant has given you, and it's really easy to make a mistake, so if you don't want to get caught out you'll often check and double check to make sure you haven't missed anything.

My tool will simplify the process, so that auditors can import the data straight from the accounts. It will only take a few clicks find and export to Excel or .pdf all journals that were posted outside working hours or could be duplicates as described above. The auditor can then use this as a checklist to do what they do best: use their industry knowledge and professional judgement to inspect the resulting journals and see if any genuine issues arise.

It doesn't expect you to change what tests you perform or how you work: I understand that most auditors just want to get the data they need into a spreadsheet that they can use as a checklist pretty much straight away.

It doesn't think it can replace a trained, experienced auditor's judgement.

It just performs the boring, fiddly bit of the task quickly and well, allowing the auditor to save time they can use to add more value for their client.
